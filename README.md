# Cell Atlas Approximations - Natural Language Processing
Cell atlases are single cell data sets on the scale of whole organisms. There are presumably many ways for humans to query these atlases using natural language (e.g. English), however human-atlas interactions are currently limited to Python or R programmers.

This project enables biologists, doctors, and anyone else to ask questions in their natural language (starting from English) and convert the question into a formalised query for an atlas approximation. This functionality is used internally in our [Human Interface](https://github.com/fabilab/cell_atlas_approximations_HI) web application.
